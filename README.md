## ðŸš€ Projects

### Student Dropout Classifier

- **Objective**: Predict the state of students (enrolled, dropped out, or graduated).
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Cross-validation.
- **Summary**:
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted detailed visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented label encoding, feature selection, and scaling for optimal model performance.
  - **Modeling**: Compared five machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN).
- **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of 0.75.
- **GitHub**: [View Project](https://github.com/AhmedAlaa27/NeuronetiX-Session2-Classification)

### Bank Customers Churn Prediction

- **Objective**: Predict whether a customer will churn (leave the bank) based on various features.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, StandardScaler.
- **Summary**:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset, handled categorical variables, and scaled features using StandardScaler.
  - **Feature Selection**: Analyzed correlations and removed less impactful features to enhance model performance.
  - **Modeling**: Trained and evaluated models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost), comparing accuracy to determine the best-performing model.
- **GitHub**: [View Project](https://github.com/AhmedAlaa27/Bank-Customer-Churn)

### Movie Genre Classifier

- **Objective**: Classify movies into genres based on their descriptions using machine learning models.
- **Tools Used**: Python, TF-IDF Vectorization, Logistic Regression.
- **Summary**:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the text data by removing stop words, and special characters, and performing text normalization. Applied TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical features.
  - **Model Training**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict movie genres based on the processed text data.
- **Conclusion**: The project showcases how text processing and machine learning techniques can be utilized to classify movies into genres from their descriptions.
